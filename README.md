# Thyroid Disease Recurrence Model
This project is an interactive dashboard showing 3 models used in the prediction of the recurrence of Thyroid Disease.
This was done in R utilizing flexdashboard for the interacive element. The data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and provided by Kaggle. The data features are as follows:

    Age: The age of the patient at the time of diagnosis or treatment.
    Gender: The gender of the patient (male or female).
    Smoking: Whether the patient is a smoker or not.
    Hx Smoking: Smoking history of the patient (e.g., whether they have ever smoked).
    Hx Radiotherapy: History of radiotherapy treatment for any condition.
    Thyroid Function: The status of thyroid function, possibly indicating if there are any abnormalities.
    Physical Examination: Findings from a physical examination of the patient, which may include palpation of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures.
    Adenopathy: Presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy) in the neck region.
    Pathology: Specific types of thyroid cancer as determined by pathology examination of biopsy samples.
    Focality: Whether the cancer is unifocal (limited to one location) or multifocal (present in multiple locations).
    Risk: The risk category of the cancer based on various factors, such as tumor size, extent of spread, and histological type.
    T: Tumor classification based on its size and extent of invasion into nearby structures.
    N: Nodal classification indicating the involvement of lymph nodes.
    M: Metastasis classification indicating the presence or absence of distant metastases.
    Stage: The overall stage of the cancer, typically determined by combining T, N, and M classifications.
    Response: Response to treatment, indicating whether the cancer responded positively, negatively, or remained stable after treatment.
    Recurred: Indicates whether the cancer has recurred after initial treatment.
